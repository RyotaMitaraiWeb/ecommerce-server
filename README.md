# Ecommerce server

## ``util``
This folder contains utility functions to make certain tasks easier

### errorMapper(err: any)
This function transforms errors in a consistent format across different responses. The error is most likely going to be an array with the errors, a standard error, or a Mongoose ValidationError error. In the event that it's none of those, it will return an array that indicates that the request has failed (most likely). Each element in the array has the following format:

```typescript
const arrayErrorElement = {
    msg: 'some error message'
}
```

## ``test``
This folder contains tests for each functionality of the server
